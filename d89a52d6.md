# [Assumptions for linear regresssion](https://goo.gl/JmHIET)

1. The regression model is linear in parameters (powers of variables ok, but coefficients have to be linear)
2. The mean of residuals is zero (mean(mod$residuals))
3. Homoscedasticity of residuals or equal variance (not flat plots)
4. No autocorrelation of residuals acf(lmMod$residuals) lawstat::runs.test(lmMod$residuals) lmtest::dwtest(lmMod)
5. The X variables and residuals are uncorrelated cor.test(cars$speed, mod.lm$residuals) 
6. The number of observations must be greater than number of Xs
7. The variability in X values is positive var(cars$speed)
8  The regression model is correctly specified (as if Y inverse to X)
9  No perfect multicollinearity car::vif
10. Normality of residuals qqnorm in plots
