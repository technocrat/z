# Dynamic Network Communities Detection and Generation

Description: Used for evolving network analysis regarding community detection. Implements several algorithms that calculate communities for graphs whose nodes and edges change over time. Edges, which can have new nodes, can be added or deleted. Changes in the communities are calculated without recalculating communities for the entire graph
