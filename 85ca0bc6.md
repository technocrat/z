# validate indicators

[[[9c1fd9f0]]]

> In validate, an indicator is a rule that returns an numerical value. Just like validator objects are lists of validation rules, indicator objects are lists of indicator rules. Indices can be computed by confronting data with an indicator, and using add_indices, the computed indices can be added to the dataset. You can import, export, select, and combine indicator objects in the same way as validator objects.

> A practical example is the so-called selective editing approach to data cleaning. Here, each record in a data set is assigned a number that expresses ***the risk a record poses for inferring a faulty conclusion***. Records are then ordered from high risk (records that both have suspicious values and large influence on the final result) to low risk (records with unsuspected values and little influence on the final result). Records with the highest risk are then scrutinized by domain experts.
