# [genlasso package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/genlasso/vignettes/article.pdf)

> A  simple  example  of  a  problem  which  fits  naturally  into  the  generalized  lasso  structure  is the  1d  fused  lasso.   In  the  common  signal  approximator  case,X=I,  we  assume  that the observed datay = (y1,...yn)âˆˆRn is generated from a process whose mean changes at only a smaller number of locations, when ordered sequentially from 1 to n.  The goal is hence tofind a piecewise constant vector of coefficients, of course, fitting well to y.
