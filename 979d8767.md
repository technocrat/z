# Statitics vs. machine learning

[Statistics vs. Machine Learning](https://matloff.wordpress.com/2020/07/26/efron-updates-breimans-two-cultures-essay/)

> I believe the widest gap between the two cultures involves sampling variation. It forms the very core of statistics, while ML mostly ignores it. 

>  this extends to the research level, resulting in statistical work often focusing on asymptotics, while in ML the focus is on proving finite inequalities about the data itself, no connection to a population.

> statisticians tend to use R, while ML people almost universally use Python

> However, in [our work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06850) we show something more basic: NNs are essentially performing good old-fashioned polynomial regression.
