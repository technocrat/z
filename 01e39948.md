[Test size](https://win-vector.com/2021/01/20/what-is-a-good-test-set-size/)

Divide data into training and test sets

* Pareto rule
* $2^{15}$ rule (actually 36,152 rows) calculated with  [Hoeffding's inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoeffding%27s_inequality) which
> provides an upper bound on the probability that the sum of bounded independent random variables deviates from its expected value by more than a certain amount
> We can plug in some example values:
> U 14, as above, from picking mu = 1/100.
> epsilon 0.05, or a 5 percent chance of being further then mu off in our performance estimate.
> t, say 1/10, or wanting our estimate to be likely to be with 0.1 deviance units of the unkown true value.
>This gives us any k >= ln(2/0.05) * 14^2 / (2 (1/10)^2) is good test set size. Or, if we use k >= 36152 test rows then with probability at least 95 percent we have an estimate that is within 1/10th deviance unit of the unknown true future performance of our classifier, independent of training set size and number of considered variables.
* split the data so we are improving our training and test reliabilities at roughly the same rate.
