oncise Statistical Description of a Vector, Matrix, Data Frame, or Formula

Description

describe is a generic method that invokes describe.data.frame, describe.matrix, describe.vector, or describe.formula. describe.vector is the basic function for handling a single variable. This function determines whether the variable is character, factor, category, binary, discrete numeric, and continuous numeric, and prints a concise statistical summary according to each. A numeric variable is deemed discrete if it has <= 10 distinct values. In this case, quantiles are not printed. A frequency table is printed for any non-binary variable if it has no more than 20 distinct values. For any variable for which the frequency table is not printed, the 5 lowest and highest values are printed. This behavior can be overriden for long character variables with many levels using the listunique parameter, to get a complete tabulation.
