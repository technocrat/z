Alternative to {classInt}

cut2 {Hmisc}	R Documentation
Cut a Numeric Variable into Intervals
Description
Function like cut but left endpoints are inclusive and labels are of the form [lower, upper), except that last interval is [lower,upper]. If cuts are given, will by default make sure that cuts include entire range of x. Also, if cuts are not given, will cut x into quantile groups (g given) or groups with a given minimum number of observations (m). Whereas cut creates a category object, cut2 creates a factor object.
