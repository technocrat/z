# integers are continuous in ggplot

```r
This is tricky because in many (most?) cases, integer values passed to ggplot actually do represent continuous values -- integer values are granular, but in many cases they belong on a continuous scale. In the example above, x is a continuous scale, even though integer values are used.

ggplot2 treats integer and numeric values as continuous, and it treats factors and characters as discrete (categorical).

A workaround is to use factor(z) to explicitly create discrete data:

s + geom_point(aes(shape = z, color= factor(z)), size = 4) +
  scale_shape_identity() +
  scale_color_discrete()
