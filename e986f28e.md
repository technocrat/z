This is a sales brochure in a chain of sales brochures.

1. It will be my pitch to you on what the product should look like
2. It will be your pitch to your management on what the product should be
3. It will be the client's pitch to its management on what the product should be
4. It will be client management's pitch to their investment banker on what the product should be
5. It will be the investment banker's to potential acquirers on what the product should be
6. Nobody but the potential acquirers management will pay much attention to it

This is all wrapped up in a process called in the US "due diligence." I'm sure there is an equivalent term of art in the UK and EU. Once a deal is struck to sell a company, it is contingent upon looking under the bonnet and poking around the nooks and crannies. One of the checklist items is this "plan."

No one much gives a snap about it except that it doesn't commit the buyer to anything and that it doesn't surface any fatal flaws ("Unfortunately, plutonium-239 has a half life of 24,100 years, which will require that the 2,000 tonnes of that substance on the principal site to be sequestered and maintained at a current annual cost of 2.3 million pound sterling for the indefinite future.")

This differs somewhat from what we would expect from doing a roadmap that actually committed someone to something that they wanted to do or at least to convince someone that they wanted to do.

Therefore, as a sales pitch, this is going to involve a lot of bullet points, eye candy diagrams and arm waving without a lot of real content.
