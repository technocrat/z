# Hadley on loops

> for (item in vector) perform_action

> N.B.: for assigns the item to the current environment, overwriting any existing variable with the same name:

		i <- 100
		for (i in 1:3) {}
		i

> i is now three, not 100

> There are three common pitfalls to watch out for when using for. First, if youâ€™re generating data, make sure to preallocate the output container. Otherwise the loop will be very slow; see Sections 23.2.2 and 24.6 for more details. The vector() function is helpful here.

		means <- c(1, 50, 20)
		out <- vector("list", length(means))
		for (i in 1:length(means)) {
			out[[i]] <- rnorm(10, means[[i]])
		}
		seq_along(means)

		out <- vector("list", length(means))
		for (i in seq_along(means)) {
			out[[i]] <- rnorm(10, means[[i]])
		}

> Finally, you might encounter problems when iterating over S3 vectors, as loops typically strip the attributes:

		xs <- as.Date(c("2020-01-01", "2010-01-01"))
		for (x in xs) {
			print(x)
		}


> Work around this by calling [[ yourself:

		for (i in seq_along(xs)) {
			print(xs[[i]])
		}
