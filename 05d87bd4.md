# Standardized coefficients effect on regression

[S/O thread](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/80624/how-do-standardization-and-normalization-impact-the-coefficients-of-linear-model)

> The logic of standardized coefficients is to re-express coefficients as the effect of a one-SD change in  $X_j$ as opposed to a one *unit* change in $X_j$ [handout](https://u.demog.berkeley.edu/%7Eandrew/teaching/standard_coeff.pdf)

> There is no standardized intercept. That is to say, it is identically equal to zero.(Why?) If you are looking at a regression table that has an intercept, then you arenot looking at standardized coefficients.
