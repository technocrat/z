# rollup subtotals and percentage

    mtcars %>%
      group_by(am, gear) %>%
      summarise (n = n()) %>%
      mutate(freq = n / sum(n))

    #   am gear  n      freq
    # 1  0    3 15 0.7894737
    # 2  0    4  4 0.2105263
    # 3  1    4  8 0.6153846
    # 4  1    5  5 0.3846154
    
From the dplyr vignette: 

> When you group by multiple variables, each summary peels off one level of the grouping. That makes it easy to progressively roll-up a dataset". Thus, after the summarise, the grouping variable 'gear' is peeled off, and the data is then grouped 'only' by 'am' (just check it with groups on the resulting data), on which we then perform the mutate calculation.
