# tell R that bear coordinates are in the same lat/lon reference system
# as the parks data -- BUT ONLY BECAUSE WE KNOW THIS IS THE CASE!
proj4string(bears) <- proj4string(parks)
 
# combine is.na() with over() to do the containment test; note that we
# need to "demote" parks to a SpatialPolygons object first
inside.park <- !is.na(over(bears, as(parks, "SpatialPolygons")))
inside.cd <- !is.na(over(locs, as(cd114, "SpatialPolygons")))
 
# what fraction of sightings were inside a park?
mean(inside.park)
## [1] 0.1720648
 
# use 'over' again, this time with parks as a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
# object, to determine which park (if any) contains each sighting, and
# store the park name as an attribute of the bears data
bears$park <- over(bears, parks)$Unit_Name
