# Global vs local model frameworks

> Global explanations are those that describe model behavior on the whole data set. This allows us to deduce how the model behaves generally/ usually/ on average.

> Local explanations, on the other hand, refer to a single prediction, to a specific client/property/patient on which model operates. Usually, local explanations show which and how different variables contribute to the model prediction.
