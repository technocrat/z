    p= order of the autoregressive part;
    d= degree of first differencing involved;
    q= order of the moving average part.
    
Twice order = and 

In an autoregression model, we forecast the variable of interest using a linear combination of past values of the variable. The term autoregression indicates that it is a regression of the variable against itself. AR(p) model, an autoregressive model of order p.

We normally restrict autoregressive models to stationary data.

If p and q are both positive, then the plots do not help in finding suitable values of p and q.

take q from PACF and p from ACF
