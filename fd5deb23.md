# dot . operators 

Hadley on map() map::. NE magrittr::.

The function arguments look a little quirky but allow you to refer to `.` for one argument functions, .x and .y. for two argument functions, and ..1, ..2, ..3, etc, for functions with an arbitrary number of arguments. . remains for backward compatibility but I don’t recommend magrittr’s pipe.
