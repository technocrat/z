# reproducible R environment with Docker + renv

[[[docker]]]
[[R]]

[Explainer](https://eliocamp.github.io/codigo-r/en/2021/08/docker-renv/)

> renv to register the versions of the R packages I use and to manage a local library that doesnâ€™t affect the rest of my system. With that, anyone who wants to reproduce my work could download all the code, run renv::restore() and have an R environment very similar to the one I use.

> The core idea: Docker runs basically like a virtual machine inside your computer; you can control which R version you use and which packages are installed. You can also host a docker image on Docker Hub, so that anyone can download it and spin it up on their computer within minutes.
