> Pipe a value forward into a function- or call expression and return the original value instead of the result. This is useful when an expression is used for its side-effect, say plotting or printing.

``` r
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(magrittr)
})
rnorm(200) %>%
  matrix(ncol = 2) %T>%
  plot %>% # plot usually does not return anything. 
  colSums
```
