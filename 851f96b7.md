Every R problem can be thought of with advantage as the interaction of three objects: an existing object, x , a desired object, y , and a function, f, that will return a value of y given x as an argument.

f(x)=y

Given

    a vector of integers, xi,xj…xk , and ∀xj>xj−1 —every element is at least one greater than its immediately preceding element
    a vector of doubles, vi,vj…vk
    an integer, n , representing the chosen number of elements preceding any given element xj

In terms of the objectives of this question, x is the vector in the data frame as the Month variable, v the vector as Value op equal length and y is a vector of equal length to be created as the Stability variable.

The formal statement can be amended to f(d,n)=d′

where d is the data frame, n is an argument to determine the number of preceding values of xj to consider and d' is the augmented object d .

In terms of the problem statement, the purpose is to find the number of calendar months without an interruption that have passed immediately prior to the current observation and if it meets or exceeds some threshold value, n , to select the value of Value from the preceding row as the entry for the current row's value of Stability, otherwise NA.

f can now be defined as

f = ifelse( n∑xj=1xji−1=n,yj=vj−1 ,NA)

Subsidiary functions will be helpful.

ifelse(g(x),h(v),NA)
[[R]]

For h , dplyr::lag will answer, leaving g .

g could be composed using diff, which takes a vector, such as x and returns a vector of the successive differences.

diff(c(1,3,4,5,8,9,10))
#> [1] 2 1 1 3 1 1

It may be preferable to work backward, because diff can only produce a vector of one fewer than its argument.

Using the foregoing as an indication, suggest g(x) and h(vrss)
