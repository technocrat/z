> I like your crisp distinction between stating what one "needs" vs. stating what one "knows". It really summarizes the entire debate between the CI and PO frameworks. In CI we use structure to encode what we know, PO to encode what we wish to know, and logic to connect the two. *@yudapearl* 2020-04-22

> numb about equal operator 0.11.3 adds the %==% operator. %==% implements the base R function all.equal(), comparing two numeric or integer vectors for near-equality. Unlike all.equal, %==% returns a vector for every element of the left-hand and right-hand sides. This makes it useful in functions like which or dplyr::filter.
