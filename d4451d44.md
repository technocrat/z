# Tidy evalulation

A general rule of thumb is that it is easier to describe functional relationships between variables (e.g., **z** is a linear combination of **x** and **y**, **density** is the ratio of **weight** to **volume)** than between rows, and it is easier to make comparisons between groups of observations (e.g., average of group a vs. average of group b) than between groups of columns.
