# subscripting

One rule of subscripting in R is that subscripting will always return an object of the same mode as the object being subscripted. For matrices and vectors, this is completely natural, and should never cause confusion. But for lists, there is a subtle distinction between part of a list, and the object which that part of the list represents. As a simple example, consider a list with some names and some numbers: 

    simple = list(a=c('fred','sam','harry'),b=c(24,17,19,22))
    mode(simple) [1] "list" 
    simple[2] $b [1] 24 17 19 22 
    mode(simple[2]) [1] "list" 

Although it looks as if simple[2] represents the vector, it's actually a list containing the vector; operations that would work on the vector will fail on this list:
