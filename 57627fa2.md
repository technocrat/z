# cabal install error re executives

## Error
    cabal install clay
    cabal: Cannot build the executables in the package clay because it does not
    contain any executables. Check the .cabal file for the package and make sure
    that it properly declares the components that you expect.
    
## Fix

	cabal install --lib clay
