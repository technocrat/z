# One-hot encoding

[[[Algorithms]]]
[[Terms]]

> In this technique, one-hot (dummy) encoding is applied to the features, creating a binary column for each category level and returning a sparse matrix. In each dummy variable, the label “1” will represent the existence of the level in the variable, while the label “0” will represent its non-existence.
