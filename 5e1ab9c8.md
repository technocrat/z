# sparklines

[[[kableExtra]]]

> kableExtra also provides a few inline plotting tools. Right now, there are spec_hist, spec_boxplot, and spec_plot. One key feature is that by default, the limits of every subplots are fixed so you can compare across rows. Note that in html, you can also use package sparkline to create some jquery based interactive sparklines. Check out the end of this guide for details.

    mpg_list <- split(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl)
    disp_list <- split(mtcars$disp, mtcars$cyl)
    inline_plot <- data.frame(cyl = c(4, 6, 8), mpg_box = "", mpg_hist = "",
                              mpg_line1 = "", mpg_line2 = "",
                              mpg_points1 = "", mpg_points2 = "", mpg_poly = "")
    inline_plot %>%
      kbl(booktabs = TRUE) %>%
      kable_paper(full_width = FALSE) %>%
      column_spec(2, image = spec_boxplot(mpg_list)) %>%
      column_spec(3, image = spec_hist(mpg_list)) %>%
      column_spec(4, image = spec_plot(mpg_list, same_lim = TRUE)) %>%
      column_spec(5, image = spec_plot(mpg_list, same_lim = FALSE)) %>%
      column_spec(6, image = spec_plot(mpg_list, type = "p")) %>%
      column_spec(7, image = spec_plot(mpg_list, disp_list, type = "p")) %>%
      column_spec(8, image = spec_plot(mpg_list, polymin = 5))
