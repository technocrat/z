# insert rows in matrix

[[[snips]]]
[[R]]

``` r
mat <- matrix(1:10, ncol = 2)
mat
#>      [,1] [,2]
#> [1,]    1    6
#> [2,]    2    7
#> [3,]    3    8
#> [4,]    4    9
#> [5,]    5   10
rbind(mat[1:4, ], NA, mat[5, ])
#>      [,1] [,2]
#> [1,]    1    6
#> [2,]    2    7
#> [3,]    3    8
#> [4,]    4    9

Get the indices of df1, with the string, by

		inserts <- which(df1["V"] == 'Pdp') + c(0,2:6)

The addition of c(0,2:6) takes into account that the row target of the second object increments every time a row is added. The 6 depends on the length returned by which.
