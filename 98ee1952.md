# ggmap jaggies

Due to the default settings in ggmap(), any data off the map is dropped before plotting, so some polygon boundaries are dropped and when the remaining points are joined up you get the wrong shapes.

Don't worry, there is a solution: ggmap() provides some arguments to control this behaviour. Arguments extent = "normal" along with maprange = FALSE force the plot to use the data range rather than the map range to define the plotting boundaries.

    # Fix the polygon cropping
    ggmap(corvallis_map_bw, extent="normal",maprange = FALSE,
          base_layer = ggplot(ward_sales, aes(lon, lat))) +
      geom_polygon(aes(group = group, fill = ward))

    # Repeat, but map fill to num_sales
    ggmap(corvallis_map_bw,  extent="normal",maprange = FALSE,
          base_layer = ggplot(ward_sales, aes(lon, lat))) +
          geom_polygon(aes(group = group, fill = num_sales))

    # Repeat again, but map fill to avg_price
    ggmap(corvallis_map_bw,  extent="normal",maprange = FALSE, 
          base_layer = ggplot(ward_sales, aes(lon, lat))) +
          geom_polygon(aes(group = group, fill = avg_price))
