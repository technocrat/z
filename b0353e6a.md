    Observation Equation

TimeSeries=Trend+Seasonality+Regression+Noise
Yt=Ut+St+βTXt+ϵt

    State/Transition/Process Equation

Ut=Ut−1+δt−1+ωt
δt=δt−1+vt
St=∑s=1s−1St−s+γt

Where ϵt, ωt, vt and γt are independent components of Gaussian random noise. Ut is the current level of the trend, the current slop of the trend is δt. The seasonal component St can be thought of as a set of s of seasons. Xt is the external regressors and βT is the regression coefficien
