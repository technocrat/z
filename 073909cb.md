# Premature optimization is the root of all evil.

*Donald Knuth*


In “Structured Programming with Goto Statements”, Computing Surveys 6:4 (December 1974), pp. 261–301, §1. Knuth refers to this quotation as “Hoare’s Dictum” 15 years later in “The Errors of TeX”, Software—Practice & Experience 19:7 (July 1989), pp. 607–685. However, the attribution to of the quotation to Hoare is dubious.[2]

We should forget about small efficiencies,say about 97% of the time: pre-mature optimization is the root of all evil. [1]@268
