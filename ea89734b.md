# %vin% operator

> Details
R's basic comparison operators (almost) always return NA when one of the operands is NA. The %in% operator is an exception. Compare for example NA %in% NA with NA == NA: the first results in TRUE, while the latter results in NA as expected. The %vin% operator acts consistent with operators such as ==. Specifically, NA results in the following cases.

> For each position where x is NA, the result is NA.

	When table contains an NA, each non-matched value in x results in NA.
