Count data are the result of a process of measuring the number of discrete events over some period of time.

Typically, these models assume that the process that generates the events is independent of time (t).  

This meansthat they are memoryless. 

The times between events are assumed to be independent and exponentially distributed.

This is a very strong set of restrictions:  most event data violate them in one or more ways.
