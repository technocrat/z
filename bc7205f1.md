[DaQAPO - Data Quality Assessment for Process-Oriented data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/daqapo/vignettes)


> Process mining techniques generate valuable insights in business processes using automatically generated process execution data. However, despite the extensive opportunities that process mining techniques provide, the garbage in - garbage out principle still applies. Data quality issues are widespread in real-life data and can generate misleading results when used for analysis purposes. Currently, there is no systematic way to perform data quality assessment on process-oriented data. To fill this gap, we introduce DaQAPO - Data Quality Assessment for Process-Oriented data. It provides a set of assessment functions to identify a wide array of quality issues.

> We identify two stages in the data quality assessment process:

    1. Reading and preparing data;
    2. Assessing the data quality - running quality tests.

> If the user desires to remove anomalies detected by quality tests, he has the ability to do so.
