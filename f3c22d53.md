EPSG:4326 = WGS84 (Google and military)

ESPG:4269 = NAD83 (most civilian us.gov agencies)

> Although WGS84 and NAD83 are not equivalent, for most applications they are considered equivalent. Transforming between NAD83 and WGS84 typically isnâ€™t recommended for most applications because standard transformations can introduce error that is large relative to their difference. Complicating the matter, the difference between NAD83 and WGS84 varies with time and location.
