# ARIMA parameter selection

[[[ARIMA]]]
[[NB]]

There are two cases:

* **non**-seasonal data, with `order = c(p,d,q)`
* **seasonal** data with the addition of `seasonal = c(P,D,Q)`

where $p =$ order of autoregressive part, $d =$ order of differencing and $q =$ order of moving average part.

---

*p: Order* autoregressive part is found with PACF lag that first falls within confidence interval and stays there

*d: Order* differencing can be found with `feasts::unitroot_ndiffs`

*q: Order*  moving average can be found with the ACF lag that first falls within the confidence interval and stays there

---

*P: Seasonal* autoregressive part a bit mysterious. [*See* text](https://otexts.com/fpp3/seasonal-arima.html)

*D: Seasonal* differencing part with `feasts::unitroot_nsdiffs` n***s***diffs

*Q: Seasonal* moving average part with PACF spikes at multiples
